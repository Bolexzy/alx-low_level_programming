# Singly linked lists

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at Alx. It aims to learn about singly linked lists in **C** language.

## Technologies
 
* Scripts written in Bash 5.0.17(1)
* C files are compiled using gcc 9.4.0
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files

All of the following are programs written in C:

Filename | Description
--- | ---
`0-print_listint.c` | Prints all the elements of a `listint_t` list.
`1-listint_len.c` | Returns the number of elements in a linked `listint_t` list.
