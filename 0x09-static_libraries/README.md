Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies facilitated by ALX. It aims to learn about static libraries in C language.

## Technologies

* Scripts written in Bash 5.0.17(1)
* C files are compiled using gcc 9.4.0
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
