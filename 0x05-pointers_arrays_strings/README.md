# Pointers, arrays and strings

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies facilitated by ALX. Itaims to learn about data structures, algorithms, pointers and arrays in C language.

## Technologies

* C files are compiled using gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files

All of the following files are programs written in C:

Filename | Description
--- | ---
`0-reset_to_98.c` | Takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to `98`
`1-swap.c` | Swaps the values of two integers.
`2-strlen.c` | Returns the length of a string.
`3-puts.c` | Prnts a string.
`4-print_rev.c` | Prints a string in reverse.
`5-rev_string.c` | Reverses string.
`6-puts2.c` | Prints every other character of a string, starting with the first
`7-puts_half.c` | Prints half of a string.
`8-print_array.c` | Prints `n` elements of an array of integers.
` 9-strcpy.c` | Copiesthe string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte, to the buffer pointed to by `dest`
`100-atoi.c` | Converts a string to an intege:r
`101-keygen.c` | Generates random valid passwords for the program `101-crackme`
