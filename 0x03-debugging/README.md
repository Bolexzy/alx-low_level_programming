# Debugging

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at Holberton School. It aims to learn how to debug in C language.

## Technologies

* Scripts written in Bash 5.0.17(1)
* C files are compiled using gcc 9.4.0
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files

All of the following files are programs written in C:

Filename | Description
