# Functions, nested loops

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at Alx. It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in C language.

## Technologies

* C files are compiled using gcc 4.8.4
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
