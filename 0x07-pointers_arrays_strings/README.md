# Even more pointers, arrays and strings

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX. It aims to learn about pointers and arrays in C language.

## Technologies

* C files are compiled using gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files

All of the following files are programs written in C:

Filename | Description
--- | ---
`0-memset.c` | Fills memory with a constant byte.
`1-memcpy.c` | Copies memory area.
`2-strchr.c` | Locates a character in a string.
`3-strspn.c` | Gets the length of a prefix substring
`4-strpbrk.c` | Searches a string for any set 0f bytes.
