# Malloc, free

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies facilitated by ALX.  It aims to learn about automatic and dynamic allocation in C language.

## Technologies

* Scripts written in Bash 5.0.17(1)
* C files are compiled using gcc 9.4.0
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files

All of the following files are programs written in C:
Filename | Description
--- | ---
`0-create_array.c` | Creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
`1-strdup.c` | Returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
`2-str_concat.c` | Concatenates two strings.
`3-alloc_grid.c` | Returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers
`4-free_grid.c` | Frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your `alloc_grid` function.
