# Functions, nested loops

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at Alx. It aims to learn about function pointers in C language.

## Technologies
 
* Scripts written in Bash 5.0.17(1)
* C files are compiled using gcc 9.4.0
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files

All of the following are programs written in C:

Filename | Description
--- | ---
`0-print_name.c` | prints a name
`1-array_iterator.c` | Executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array
`2-int_index.c` | Searches for an integer
`3-calc.h` | 	Header file that contains all function prototypes and data structures
`3-op_functions.c` | File that contains functions that calculates arithmetic operations
`3-get_op_func.c` | Function pointer that returns the pointer of the arithmetic functions
`3-main.c` | Entry point
